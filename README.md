How hard can it be to write a simple Little Professor clone as an experiment in using BootstrapVueNext? About 2 hours.

pnpm run dev
```

...should probably work, then check [http://localhost:5173/](localhost:5173)

## TODO

Obviously there are loads of possible improvements; whether I'll ever have time to do them is another matter.
